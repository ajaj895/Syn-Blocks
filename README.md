# README
A Codeblocks style code learning tool for learning language specific syntax, my contribution to the OpenHacks hackathon.

## USAGE
You can run the following by either opening the Syn-Blocks.jar in the dist directory or by running the following:

java -jar path/to/jar/dist/Syn-Blocks.jar

A GUI program should come up when you open the jar with the software tool.

## ABOUT
Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, many people such as myself have been stuck inside with nothing to do and still wanting to learn. That's what inspired me to create this along with the inspiration from other software such as Scratch or code.org where they use drag & drop programming tools that help people understand the concepts of programming. What sets my project apart from that is that my project uses the actual syntax for Java and someone can create a simple java program with my drag and drop tool with relative ease.

To do the drag and drop, make sure you highlight the text before clicking and dragging the selected text to the block of your choice.
